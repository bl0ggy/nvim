## Personal configuration for NeoVim

This is my first time using NeoVim and creating a configuration.

the configuration was made by watching ThePrimeagen's setup video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE.

He uses Packer in the video, but it seems that plugin manager is deprecated and Lazy is now recommended.

So I tried to follow his config with Lazy, without knowing the following:
- we can `return` config arrays from lua/plugins,
- there is LazyVim that contains a preconfiguration.

I could improve those, but I'll stick to my current setup until I know more about *Vim.
